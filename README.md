# About the IoTFuse 2019 Workshops

IoT Fuse is (or was, depending upon when you read this) a Conference Series which takes palce April 23rd-25th, 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Information about the event can be found [here](https://www.iotfuse.com/).

The event series is split up into two separate sections:

  - Workshops on April 23rd and 24th, 2019 at the University of St. Thomas in downtown Minneapolis.
  - The larger Conference on April 25th, 2019 at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
  
The idea behind the seperation of the two events is basically that the workshops themselves are more techincal in nature, while the conference has some high level techincal overviews, but is laregely, "use case discussion" in nature.  We have found over the years that there are really two different audiences for these two different types of programming, but often the audiences are looking to "fuse together" knowledge across professions in order to more effectively learn.

Basically, some engineers and developers find it helpful to listen to business discussions, while some purely marketing focused individuals find it helpful to dabble a bit in code.

Overall, it's all about collaboration and getting things done.

# Open Source Overall

The actual schedule for the workshops can be found [here](https://iotfuseworkshops2019.sched.com/).

For those who are not able to attend, but still are interested in the code behind the workshop series, you can check that out below.

This list may not be complete, so please message us if you find anything missing or would like us to inquire about any code which may have not been open sourced.

Overall, our objective is to further the state of Internet of Things development worldwide.  Our goal is not only to provide useful information to the attendees of the conference, but to curate information for Internet of Things Developers regardless of where they come from.

## The Open Source Repos Themselves

These repos will be posted below in order according to how they roughly fit into the technology stack.  To see the full schedule and make inquiries for further code, see the above link to the workshops schedules.

#### Quick Note On Organization

We have recieved requests to post information in chronological order according to when they occured in the workshop for those who attended - the problem with that is that not all workshops have open source code, and this organizational structure is not as readable to those who attended the workshops themselves.  It is our hope that by organizing according to "technological category," individuals will be able to access this repo in the future and index according to what problem they are attempting to solve.
