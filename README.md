# About the IoTFuse 2019 Workshops

IoT Fuse is (or was, depending upon when you read this) a Conference Series which takes palce April 23rd-25th, 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Information about the event can be found [here](https://www.iotfuse.com/).

The event series is split up into two separate sections:

  - Workshops on April 23rd and 24th, 2019 at the University of St. Thomas in downtown Minneapolis.
  - The larger Conference on April 25th, 2019 at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
  
The idea behind the seperation of the two events is basically that the workshops themselves are more techincal in nature, while the conference has some high level techincal overviews, but is laregely, "use case discussion" in nature.  We have found over the years that there are really two different audiences for these two different types of programming, but often the audiences are looking to "fuse together" knowledge across professions in order to more effectively learn.

Basically, some engineers and developers find it helpful to listen to business discussions, while some purely marketing focused individuals find it helpful to dabble a bit in code.

Overall, it's all about collaboration and getting things done.
